# Task
Our aim is to create a c++ algorithm to create BFS, DFS and A* pathfinding algorithm.
After Completion of each step, we make a pull request and merge to main.
# Steps
1> Make a c++ program with a class to create a grid object.
2> Add a class to manage BFS.
3> Add a class to manage DFS.
4> Add a class to manage A* Path finding algo.
5> Refactor the codebase.
